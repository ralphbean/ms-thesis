   There are several approaches to using the neural networks for control of chaotic processes. First,
many studies rely on the universal ability of the neural networks to control and predict behavior
of the nonlinear systems. Since the chaotic systems are basically nonlinear, the potentiality of
their neural control is not surprising. Some universal neural-like learning networks for control of
nonlinear systems were suggested in [150, 151, 239]. The structures of neural networks for control
and prediction of the processes in nonlinear chaotic systems can be found in [61, 107, 145]. The
papers [169, 245] compare the neural approach with other methods of control. It was proposed in
[192, 284] to use the genetic algorithms for learning the neural network. A numerical example is
considered, and the results of modeling are presented for it.
   Second, many papers describe identification of the controlled plants by the neural networks
combined with a standard method of control of chaotic systems such as the OGY-method [132],
proportional feedback controller [170], and so on. Identification often is carried out in the closed
loop in the course of normal system operation, which leads to adaptive or learning controllers. It was

noted that the chaotic nature of the system processes speeds up identification and learning owing
to diversification of the learning sample [92, 226, 251]. Some papers study new, nontraditional
algorithms of identification and control. For example, [110] proposes a new approach to learning
(adjustment of weights and modification of structure) of a serial neural network which lies in using
controller, chaotic neural filter, and associative memory.
