The report is in the root directory:  thesis.pdf
LaTeX sources for the report and other documents are in the doc/ directory.

The code for the project is in the src directory.
  ./ga.py runs the genetic algorithm for certain operator combinations.
      Operators are specified by integers.
  The files src/combo1.txt and src/combo2.txt contain (between them)
      every combination of operators.  src/ga_runner.sh makes use of them
      to run every combination.

  The visualization_scripts/ directory contains code for producing images
    and videos of the genetic algorithm's data.

__old_stuff/ contains preliminary work from 2008
